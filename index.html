                    Your boss comes up to you just before lunch: “OK, we just picked up this job, but I need it on my
                    desk (well, in my inbox) in four hours. It doesn’t need to be perfect… it needs to be as close to
                    perfect as you can get it in that time.”

                    In lab today you will be building a single webpage based off of the provided design comp assets.
                    This assignment is a lot of HTML and CSS, and not as much JS as we’ve been doing this week. In fact,
                    you may choose to do this project with no JS at all, or just add some as a finishing touch.

                    This will be a pair-programming project, and you are free to set up whatever workflow you choose
                    with your partner.

                    You only have 4 hours to complete this assignment.
